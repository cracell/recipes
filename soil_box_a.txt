Soil


Tested my Mel's Mix and the ph is at least 7.5. Want to lower it to 6.5. 

Iron Sulfate and Aluminum sulfate lower ph.

Need to add .2 of a pound of Aluminum sulfate


Other tests (on 72 hour old soil water mix)

K Test (Potash)

K3 Sufficient

Phosporus test
P4 Surplus



Nitrogen test


N- depleted (may have simply evaporated)





Based on these tests and other reading instead of directly altering Ph I want to try adding addition composts and testing with lettuce.



Add handfuls of chicken manure, steer manure and general compost and mixed in on March 23rd. Need to retest ph in 30 days and try added lettuce and seeing how it grows.
