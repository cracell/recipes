Strawberry Ice Cream

3 cups fresh ripe strawberries, stemmed and sliced
4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 1/2 cups sugar, divided
1 1/2 cups whole milk
2 3/4 cups heavy cream
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

In a small bowl, combine the strawberries with the lemon juice and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Stir gently and allow the strawberries to macerate in the juices for 2 hours. Strain the berries, reserving juices. Mash or puree half the berries.

In a medium mixing bowl, use a hand mixer on low speed to combine the milk and remaining granulated sugar until the sugar is dissolved, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in the heavy cream, reserved strawberry juice, mashed straberries, and vanilla.

Turn the machone on; pour the mixture into freezer bowl, and let mix until thickened, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Five minutes beofre mixing is completed, add the reserved sliced strawberries and let mix in completely. The ice cream will have a sof, creamy texture. If a firmer consistency is desired, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and place in freezerr for about 2 hours. Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving.

Notes from first time making: Way too much ice cream for just me and Candle. Should half it. And should mash and add in all strawberries to begin with.
