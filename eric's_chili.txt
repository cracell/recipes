Eric's Chili

6 Dried Guajillo Chili Pods
6 Japanese Chili Pods
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
1 whole red onion diced
1 pablano pepper diced
1 anahiem pepper diced
1 lb beef chuck roast diced into chili sized chunks.
1 beer
32 oz can crushed tomatos
8 cloves of garlic.
Green onions diced
cheddar cheese


1. Cut up dried chili peppers and simmer dried chili peppers in beer untill soft. (Or you can grind them using a coffee grinder)

2. Cut up chuck roast into chili sized chunks. Sear one side of them. Grind on some salt and pepper while searing, only sear one side to leave them nice and tender but with the mallard effect for added taste.

3. Once dried chili peppers are soft blend them using a food processor or immersion blender.

4. Add blended peppers with beer, meat and crushed tomatos to the main pot and begin simmer uncovered.

5. While simmering add fresh peppers, garlic, cumin, pepper, salt, oregeno, cinnamon.

6. Simmer for an hour. Leave uncovered while is boils down but cover when it gets to the desired thickness.

7. Add in onion and simmer for another 30 minutes.

8. Taste during the simmer and make any spice adjustments as needed.

9. Once finished, garnish with green onions and put some cheddar cheese on top.




Notes: Dried chili peppers have a much richer flavour than chili powders. Tried adding bacon and I didn't think it added much to the flavour. A lot of people recommend using Stella Artois or Guiness for the beer. A good italian sausage could be a great meat subsitute.


Used dried Guajillo Chili Pods which were fruity and nice.
Used Japanese Chili Pods which were hot and spicy. Similiar to a jalapeno is spiciness I think. Often used in asian dishes, the taste reminds me of the spice in some stir frys/asian dishes.


Maybe we could add zucchini next time?
