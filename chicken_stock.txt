When I made it I pretty much just added water under the chicken was covered. Lots of evaporized occured and it probably could've used a bit more. And I added a bit of carrots, celery and onion. Seemed to be very healthy and tasty mixed in a soup.


Also could add parsley and garlic

Egg shells - "All the ends and bits of vegetables, including onion skins, etc., are the most nutritious parts of the vegetable and lend flavor to the stock. It's great if you can save them and add them in.

As for eggshells, it's some of the most bio-available form of calcium (add a little vinegar when boiling), very similar to our own composition. I haven't tried it yet, but will be saving my shells from now on. It always felt a little weird to throw them out, and am excited now that I can stick it in the freezer collection bag."


Reuse bones
You sure canâ€”Paul Jaminet of The Perfect Health Diet says you can reuse bones to make multiple batches of broth until the bones go soft. (Make sure you use fresh vegetables, herbs, and spices each time, though.)
