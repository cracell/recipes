# Egg Pie

## Ingredients
- 9 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 3 cups frozen hash brown potatoes (thawed)
- 1 1/2 cups monterey jack cheese, divided
- 2 cups brocolli, branched and chopped
- 1/2 cup onion

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
1. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Add salt and let sit while other ingredients are prepared.
1. Combine all ingredients but reserve some cheese for on top.
1. Pour into buttered pie pan and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
1. Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 35 minutes, until temperate is 165f - 185f in center (tastes overcooked past 185f).
1. Remove from oven, and let sit on rack 5 minutes before serving

## Tips
- The warmer the eggs and hash browns are the less time it will take to cook. Which can help prevent the edges from overcooking

## Things that don't work well
- Using green onion doesn't taste great compared to white
- Frozen spinach didn't taste great, fresh might be better

Butter greasing worked well
2/3rds the potato
Asparagus and chicken sausage inside
pure cheddar cheese.
