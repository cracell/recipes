Goes well with corn bread.

First time made it with this cornbread recipe, Candle liked it, I thought it was too floury
Cornbread dry ingredients were a cup of flour and a cup of cornmeal. Mix with a tablespoon baking powder and a pinch of paprika. Wet were two eggs, half cup milk, an a cup of sour cream. Mix all of that an add a can of corn niblets, and a half cup cheddar. Top with another pinch of paprika and a sprinkle of cheese and bake (375 for about and hour depending if pan size). Toothpick test it to make sure it's done.
I forgot to say I poke holes in the cornbread with the toothpick once it is done and drizzle honey over the top while warm so it soaks in a bit.
