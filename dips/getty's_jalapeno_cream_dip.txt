Clarified butter
"One easy way of doing it is to melting butter, putting it in a plastic bag, and letting the solids separate.
And then the solids will float, and you can cut off a corner of the bag and let the liquid part drain out and then stop before the solids do."

Notes from first time making it: Went ok with carrots and celery and chips but would've be great with good bread.

Wasn't quite thick enough. Close but not there. Was quite hot enough. The jalapenos in it seemed to get less hot. Made too large of a hole for the butter to exit the bag. Got a little stringy. But very good overall.


It's actually somewhat difficult here; I usually fix it by a combination of cayenne and spicier peppers.
More roux and slightly longer cooking makes it thicker, and make sure you take it off the heat and let it cool slightly before adding the cheese.
