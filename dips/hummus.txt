Hummus

An easy to make, healthy dip for your crunchy pita chips or vegies.  Greek yogurt adds a slight tang along with a nice creaminess.  Cayenne gives a slight punch that lingers on the tongue and makes you reach for more!


1 can garbanzo beans (chick peas), rinsed
2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped
2 Tbs lemon juice
3 Tbs Tahini
2 - 3 Tbs olive oil
generous 1/4 tsp cumin
1/8 tsp cayenne
2 Tbs Greek yogurt
1-2 Tbs water
salt to taste

olive oil and paprika for garnish

Place all ingredients (with the exception of the garnish) in a food processor and process until desired consistency.  Add water 1 tablespoon at a time, using more if the hummus is too thick.  

Spoon into a serving dish and top with a swirl of olive oil (garlic oil works well!) and a sprinkle of paprika.  Serve with pita or tortilla chips or crisp vegies.
