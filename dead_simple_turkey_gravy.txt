Dead Simple Turkey Gravy

Ingredients

4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
4 tablespoons flour
1 quart homemade chicken or turkey stock, or low-sodium store-bought stock
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon marmite
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper


Procedures

1. Melt butter over medium high heat in medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add flour and stir with wooden spoon to combine. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until golden blond in color, about 2 minutes. Slowly add stock in thin stream, whisking vigorously the whole time. Whisk in soy sauce and Marmite. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve immediately or keep warm. Gravy can be made up to 1 week in advance. Store covered in refrigerator and reheat over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally until fully hot.
