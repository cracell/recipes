# Baked Doughtnuts
Yield: 1 1/2 DOZEN DOUGHNUTS/DOUGHNUT HOLES

## Ingredients
- 1 1/3 cups warm milk, 95 to 105 degrees
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Directions
1. Place the warm milk in the bowl of an electric mixer. 
1. Stir in the yeast and sugar.
1. Add the butter. 
1. Mix the eggs, flour, and salt. 
1. Beat the dough with the dough hook attachment (or with a wooden spoon and eventually your hands) for 2-3 minutes at medium speed. Adjust the dough texture by adding flour a few tablespoons at a time or more milk. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl and be very soft and smooth but still slightly sticky - don't overflour! Knead the dough for a few minutes (again, by mixer or by hand) and then transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size (the exact time will depend on the temperature of your kitchen).
1. Punch down the dough and roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness on a lightly floured counter. Using a doughnut cutter or a 2-3 inch circle cookie cutter, cut out circles in the dough. Carefully transfer the circles to a parchment- or silpat-lined baking sheet and stamp out the smaller inner circles using a smaller cutter. Be sure to make the holes large enough that as the doughnuts rise again and bake, they don't fill in the doughnut hole with the puffiness of the dough. Cover the tray with lightly greased plastic wrap. (At this point, you can refrigerate the doughnuts overnight or proceed with the recipe.) Let the doughnuts rise for about another 45 minutes, until they are puffed and nearly doubled.
1. Bake in a 375 degree F oven until the bottoms are just golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Start checking the doughnuts around minute 8. They should still be pale on top, not golden and browned, and just barely baked through.
1. Remove the doughnuts from the oven and let cool for 1-2 minutes. Dip each one in the melted butter and toss or sprinkle with the cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately.

# Glaze
Yield: enough glaze for 20 to 25 doughnuts

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar


## Directions
1. Combine milk and vanilla in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat until warm. 
1. Sift confectioners' sugar into milk mixture. Whisk slowly, until well combined. 
1. Remove the glaze from the heat and set over a bowl of warm water. 
1. Dip doughnuts into the glaze, 1 at a time, and set on a draining rack placed in a half sheet pan for 5 minutes before serving.

## Tips
- Can make night before, get out of refrigerator an hour before cooking
- Don't overknead, makes them to chewy and hard to roll out
- Halve the recipe normally
