Chocolate Cake (or cupcakes)

70 grams - 1 cup baking cocoa
227 * 2 grams - 2 cups boiling water
1 cup butter, softened
235.8 * 2 grams 2-1/4 cups sugar
4 eggs
2.5 * 2 grams - 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
150.5 * 2 grams - 2-3/4 cups cake flour
5.4 * 2 grams - 2 teaspoons baking soda
1.2 * 2 grams - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1.8 * 2 grams - 1/2 teaspoon salt

1. In a small bowl, combine cocoa and water; set aside. 
2. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
3. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
4. Beat in vanilla. 
5. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
6. Add to creamed mixture alternately with cocoa mixture, beating well after each addition.
7. Pour into three greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 350Â° for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.




3. For ganache, place chocolate in a small bowl. In a small heavy saucepan over low heat, bring cream and sugar to a boil. Pour over chocolate; whisk gently until smooth. Refrigerate for 35-45 minutes or until ganache begins to thicken, stirring occasionally.
4. For frosting, in a large bowl, beat butter until fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, milk and vanilla; beat until smooth.
Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread with 1 cup frosting. Top with second layer and 1 cup ganache; sprinkle with 1/2 cup almonds. Top with third layer; frost top and sides of cake. Warm ganache until pourable; pour over cake, allowing some to drape down the sides. Sprinkle with remaining almonds. Refrigerate until serving. Yield: 12 servings.
