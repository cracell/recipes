Yellow Cake

1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar (297 grams)
8 egg yolks
3/4 cup milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups cake flour (200 grams)
2 teaspoons baking powder (10 grams) (re-weigh yourself)
1/2 teaspoon salt (5.32grams)  (re-weigh yourself)

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 - 8 inch round pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tops spring back when lightly tapped. Cool 15 minutes before turning out onto cooling racks.

Notes from first time making: Needs to cook at a lower temperature?

Middle didn't set for a long time in 13x9 glass pan.

Added cream to fudge frosting which made it better but not that much like store frosting.
