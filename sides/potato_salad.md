# Potato Salad

## Ingredients
### Potatoes
- 4 medium all-purpose potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds)
- 2 tablespoons 
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar

### Salad
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup finely diced red onion
- 1 pickle diced
- 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or more to taste
- 1/4 - 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons mustard (go light for Candle)
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste

## Instructions
1. Add 2 quarts water to large saucepan (fill the dutch oven 3/4th full). 
1. Add potatoes, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
1. Drain potatoes and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Spread into even layer, then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons vinegar. Allow to cool to room temperature, about thirty minutes.
1. Cut the potatoes into irregular 1-inch cubes, and place in a large bowl. Add the eggs, onion, pickle, mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, and mustard and mix well with a rubber spatula. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Cover with plastic wrap placed flush against the potatoes and chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. (The salad keeps for up to 3 days refrigerated.) Check the seasoning before serving, and add salt and pepper to taste if needed.
