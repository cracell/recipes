My Favorite Potato Salad

4 medium all-purpose potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds)
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or more to taste
2 tablespoons sugar

2 hard-boiled eggs, roughly chopped
1 small onion (2 to 3 ounces), cut into 1/4~inch dice
1 large stalk celery, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice (1/2 cup)
2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped
1/4 cup sweet relish
2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley
1/4 cup Hellmann's mayonnaise
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 teaspoons mustard
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
Six slices of crumbled, smoked bacon (optional)


1. Add 2 quarts water to large saucepan (fill the dutch oven 3/4th full). Add potatoes, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.

2. Drain potatoes and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Spread into even layer, then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons vinegar. Allow to cool to room temperature, about thirty minutes.

3. Cut the potatoes into irregular 1-inch cubes, and place in a large bowl. Add the eggs, onion, celery, scallions, pickle, parsley, mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, and mustard and mix well with a rubber spatula. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Cover with plastic wrap placed flush against the potatoes and chill for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. (The salad keeps for up to 3 days refrigerated.) Check the seasoning before serving, and add salt and pepper to taste if needed. If you're going to add the bacon, now is the time to cook, drain, and crumble six slices. Just before serving, top the potato salad with the crumbled bacon.

Notes from making: The spices seemed to weak and not enough mayo/oil. But potatos had a good texture.
