Fried Chicken Strips Recipe

Marinade

1 1/2 cups buttermilk (enough to cover chicken in a bag)
3 chicken breasts cut into  1-inch thick strips against the grain
1 1/2 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoons onion powder

Flour mixture

2 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon marjoram
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder


1. Soak the chicken overnight in salted buttermilk marinade. The combination makes for wonderfully juicy, tender, flavorful meat under that crunchy crust.

2. Take marinade out of fridge and let it come to room temperature for 1 hour. This allows the chicken to cook much faster on the inside.

2. Combine flour mixture in bag.

3. Take chicken straight from marinade into flour bag, two at a time. Remove from flour bag into fryer.

4. Fry chicken at 325degrees in deep fryer or cast iron pan with peanut oil or grapeseed oil ideally.



Next time try an extra crispy recipe, probably should add egg to coating
