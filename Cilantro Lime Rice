(~12 servings, ~125 Cal, 24g Carb, 2g Protein, >2g Fat, 0g Fiber)
Ingredients
2 cups Basmati Rice
10 cups Water
2 tsp Salt
2 tbsp Olive Oil
1 medium Lime, juiced (or 1 1/2 small; it is winter here in the States) -- about 2-3 tbsp
2 tbsp Cilantro, chopped (leave off the larger stems)
Directions
In a large stock pot or dutch oven, bring the water, salt, and olive oil to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the basmati rice and cook, at a boil, for 11-12 minutes, until it's cooked through and each grain is soft and noticeably extended.
Drain the rice (may have to work in batches for this step if you have a small strainer like me; if so, add a little hot water to the remaining rice in the main pot after draining some into your strainer, so it doesn't stick to the hot metal) and rinse briefly with warm-to-hot water; this will encourage the grains to stay separated better. It will also wash off some amount of the oil, but not enough to make a significant difference in calories.
Gently fold in the lime juice and cilantro with a fork or flexible spatula, taking care to not break up the rice grains (which will give you a sticky mess).
Can be microwaved to rewarm--serve a little bit into a microwave-safe container and add a small sprinkle of water, then nuke it, covered, to soften it up a bit before serving again.
