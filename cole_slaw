Cole Slaw

1 Tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup mayo
1/4 teaspoon celery seed (optional, but AWESOME)
Salt and pepper to taste
1 bag shredded cabbage.

1. Add the sugar and the vinegar into a bowl and whisk together until the sugar dissolves, 1 minute. Then add the mayo and some salt and pepper. Whisk again until smooth and creamy.

2. Toss 3/4 of the dressing with the cabbage in a large bowl.  Then see if you need more dressing for your taste. (I usually add all of it). Taste some cabbage and see if you need more salt or pepper.

Variations:

Add a teaspoon (or more) of Trader Joeâ€™s Taco seasoning for a SW coleslaw
Add grated apples or sliced celery to the cabbage
Add grated carrots or sliced sweet onions to cabbage for color and sweetness

Notes from first time making
Made like twice as much as needed and had to add extra mayo to make it not watering. Probably should cut in half. Also a greek yogurt instead of mayo base might be good if we can find a recipe for it. Candle said it needed more sugar, probably should half the vinergar and celery seed but leave mayo and sugar the same.
