Quinoa

Rinse to remove saponins. Or some say same effect can be acheived by toasted until slighting brown. This breaks them down.


Cook like rice at a 1:2 quinoa to water ratio.

Online people suggest a 1:1 - 1:1.5 ratio to make it less mushy.

"You just toast in the pot you'll cook it in, over med to high heat, stirring often, until coloured a little and it smells amazing. Then add stock, I do 1:1.5 grain to liquid. I usually also add a couple of strips of lemon peel peeled with a standard vegetable peeler. Or you can amp it up with soy sauce, ginger and sesame oil. Some sites claim you can toast wet, rinsed quinoa but I find the water causes some to steam while toasting and you end up with a gluey mess before you even add your liquid. EDIT: in a dry pot, you don't need oil for this."




Tried toast technique with 1:1.5 ratio. Seems to have worked for the soap problem. Not sure about this water ratio. Thinking of trying 1:1.75 next.
