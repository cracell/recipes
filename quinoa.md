# Quinoa

## Ingredients
- 100 grams (1/2 cup) quinoa
- 150 grams water
- 4 cloves garlic (optional)

## Instructions
1. Preheat saucepan to around 200f over medium heat
1. Add quinoa to sauce pan. Stir frequently until quinoa temperature is 250f or starts popping. Don't burn it!
1. Add water and garlic.
1. Cook for 8-12 minutes until water is absorbed

## Notes
- You must remove the saponins! Quinoa has bitter saponins that will give you a stomach ache if they are not removed. They break down at 250f or can be rinsed with water. In my experience even very thorough rinsing leaves too many.
- Water to quinoa ratio can be varied between 1:1 to 1:1.6
