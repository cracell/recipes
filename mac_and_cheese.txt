Macaroni and Cheese:

macrononi noodles
3 tablespoons butter
dijon mustard
dried thyme
oregano
cayenne
flour
milk
4 cups of cheese (recommend sharp cheddar) (16 ounces)


1. Put a large pot of well salted water on to boil. While it comes to a boil, start sauce. When it comes to a boil, add one 16 ounce box of shaped pasta (elbow, corkscrew, shells, something that holds onto sauce well).
2. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, melt some butter at least 3 or 4 tablespoons and saute finely diced onion and garlic until translucent.
3. Add a glob of dijon mustard (about a Tbsp), some dried thyme or oregano, a dash of cayenne (or tobasco) and sprinkle in about 2 or 3 Tbsp of flour, stir well. If the flour comes together in a very large glob, you may need to add a touch more flour to smooth out the roux. Cook the roux until ever so slightly golden.
Add in a cup of milk and mix into the roux well. There are going to be globs for a bit, it will be fine, use a whisk to help. Add in two more cups of flour and stir frequently over medium heat until hot and thick.
At this time, add in about 4 cups of shredded cheese. I usually use a mix of cheeses. My favorite blend is mozzarella, gruyere, cheddar, and fontina. Taste the sauce and salt and pepper to taste.
Once the pasta cooks, and cook it just shy of full al dente, still a tad of crunch to it, drain and add into the sauce (which is why you need a LARGE one). Mix well.
Dump the whole conglomeration into a well-buttered baking dish, a 13x9x2 usually works well. Dump more cheese on top and if you are feeling fancy, some crushed crackers or potato chips for crunch (or I've even done toasted panko dotted with a touch of butter)
Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes until the cheesy on top is melted and browned to your liking.

Notes: The cheese sauce wasn't great the first time. Modernist cuisine has a recipe that should be able to fix this.



Try in cast iron skillet: http://www.macheesmo.com/2010/07/cast-iron-mac-and-cheese/
