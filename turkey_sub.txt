1 Italian Baquette Roll
handfuls of cold shredded but chunky turkey
whole-berry cranberry sauce

Cut open the italian roll and spread mayonnaise onto it. Next layer the turkey being sure to get the edges and cover all of the bottom of the roll. Next cover the turkey in 1/2 cm of cranberry sauce. Then spread the stuffing about 1 1/2 cm thick on top of the cranberry sauce.

Close the sub and enjoy!
