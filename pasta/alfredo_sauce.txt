Alfredo Sauce

Use 1 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup butter and simmer until thickened and reduced by about half. Add a dash of nutmeg and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss with your noodles and top with freshly grated parmesan. It's delish!

shit you don't need or want.
Alfredo sauce:
in the very least you need
2 sticks butter
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup Parmesan cheese
whole nutmeg
Don't skimp on the cheese. Don't use the canned shit. I usually have a good sized chunk of parmesan-reggiano on hand because that shit is just about good on everything.
Anyway, melt the butter, add the cream. Whisk. Add the cheese. Gently stir it all together and then grate some nutmeg. Not too much. You're not making eggnog here. Season with some white pepper. Or black if you don't care about having a clean looking sauce.
With the basic sauce you can do anything you want with it. I like to take whole garlic and toss it into the pan with the cream and simmer it until the garlic is soft enough to mash then add the rest. I also like to toss in a generous amount of poppy seeds to give it a bit of interesting flavour and slight crunch.
