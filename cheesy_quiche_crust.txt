Makes 1 pie crust (2 pie crusts)

3/4 cup (1-1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
6 table (3/4 cup) spoons cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup  (1/2 cup) shredded Cheddar cheese
5 teaspoons (3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon) cold water

1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon cold water

Place flour in a large bowl. Sprinkle in the chopped butter; rub butter into the flour until it resembles bread crumbs. Stir in the grated cheese. Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a teaspoon at a time, stirring lightly with a fork. Add just enough water to allow the dough form a ball and cleanly leave the sides of the bowl. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out dough, and place in a 9 inch pie/quiche pan. Use a fork to prick holes over the bottom of the pastry.
Bake crust in preheated oven for 10 minutes before filling with quiche custard of your choice.


Note: The refrigration part is important, when I first made this I didn't refrigrate it long enough and the crust slid down during prebaking. In the end part of the egg was right up against the pan.
