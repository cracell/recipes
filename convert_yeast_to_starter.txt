Convert Yeast to Starter

A cup of active sourdough starter has about the same rise potential as a package of yeast. So, substitute a cup of starter for each package of yeast and then subtract about 1/2 cup of water and 3/4 cup of flour from the recipe to compensate for the water and flour in the starter. You'll probably want to play with the ratio between the flour and water, and adjust the amount of riser to get the results you want, but this rule of thumb is a good starting point.


1 package of yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) subsitute via

1 cup of active starter
Remove 1/2 cup water from recipe
Remove 3/4 cup of flour from recipe.










Each feeding should be equal amounts of water and flour, by weight. You can use about 2 parts of water to 3 parts of flour by volume as an approximation
