Thai Chicken Curry


2 tbsp. oil
1 onion, chopped
2 lb boneless chicken breast or thighs, cut into strips
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced 
2 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 (14 oz) cans coconut milk 
8-10 tbsp. massaman curry paste (or red curry paste)*
1 (8 oz) jar satay sauce
1 red pepper, chopped
3 oz. roasted peanuts

*The more curry paste, the spicier. If you can't find massaman paste, you can use red curry but it tends to be spicier.

1. Heat oil in a soup pot. Add onion.
2. Cook onion for a few minutes, until onion starts to change color.
3. Add chicken and garlic. Stir and saute until no longer pink.
4. Add carrots and potatoes.
5. Add coconut milk and curry paste and stir well. I used 8 tbsp. curry paste and thought it could have used more, it was only a little spicy.
6. Simmer until potatoes soften, about 15 minutes.
7. Add satay sauce and stir well.
8. Add red pepper. Simmer an additional 5 minutes.
9. Add peanuts. Stir again and simmer for 2 more minutes.
10. Serve over rice!

Notes from first time making: The chicken was a bit tough. I think it would be better salted and marinaded or dry rubbed with something over night. Not sure what.
