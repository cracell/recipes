Egg Drop Soup

4 cups chicken broth, divided
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch

3 eggs lightly beaten




1. Reserve 3/4 cup of chicken broth, and pour the rest into a large saucepan. Stir the salt, ginger and chives into the saucepan, and bring to a rolling boil. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the remaining broth and cornstarch until smooth. Set aside.
2. Stir in the cornstarch mixture gradually until the soup is the desired consistency
3. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolk together using a fork. Drizzle egg a little at a time from the fork into the boiling broth mixture. Egg should cook immediately. Once the eggs have been dropped.


Thickner equal parts corn starch mixed with cold water


My dad has used this technique for years, and I've always seen it succeed. First, he adds corn starch to the soup while it's boiling, to give a thicker medium for the egg. Then, he turns off the heat, waits for a bit, then adds the egg. This prevents the water that's boiling/bubbling at the bottom of the pot from disturbing the eggs too much. Finally, he gives just one or two swishes of the egg with chopsticks. Any more and it breaks them apart too much, any less and the egg clumps together and you get scrambled eggs in soup.

First time it turned into a weird goup. Added too much corn starch and water wasn't hot enough when I added the eggs. And 1 tablespoon was way too much soy sauce. Maybe closer to a teaspoon or a splash
