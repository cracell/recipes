Caramel Corn


1 gallon of popped popcorn (no need for added butter or oil, just pop the kernels "dry"
1 cup peanuts (optional)
1  cups brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
 
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

2. Pop a gallon of popcorn
3. Put your popped popcorn and optional 1 cup of peanuts in a large bowl
4. In a saucepan combine brown sugar, butter, water and salt and bring it to a boil. Boil for about 5 minutes until it reaches "soft ball stage" (basically just till it starts to thicken and coats the back of a spoon).
5. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and baking soda (Do this quick cause it will bubble and puff up).
6. Pour it over your popped popcorn and peanuts and toss it till all the popcorn is coated with the yummy sugar! 
7. Line 1 cookie sheet with parchment paper and spread your caramel corn out onto the sheet.
8. Bake for 25 minutes stirring several times during baking.
9. (While your caramel corn is baking) In a double boiler, melt some chocolate (optional)
10. Pull out your caramel corn and drizzle the melted chocolate generously over your caramel corn. 
11. Let it cool and then watch out cause it will go quickly!!
