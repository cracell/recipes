Peanut Brittle

1 cup (196.9 grams) white sugar
1/2 cup (160.7 grams) light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon (1.6 grams) salt
1/4 cup (60.5 grams) water
1 cup raw peanuts or raw Spanish peanuts
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon baking soda 


1. Grease a large cookie sheet. Warm in oven at 200F.
2. In a heavy 2 quart saucepan, over medium heat, bring to a boil sugar, corn syrup, salt, and water. Stir until sugar is dissolved. 
3. Stir in peanuts. 
4. Set candy thermometer in place, and continue cooking. Stir frequently until temperature reaches 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), or until a small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water separates into hard and brittle threads. Be careful not to burn it by going over 300 degrees F.
5. Remove from heat; immediately stir in butter and baking soda; pour at once onto cookie sheet. With 2 forks, lift and pull peanut mixture into rectangle about 14x12 inches; cool. Snap candy into pieces.




Try with 
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper mix with peanuts
try 1/8th's next time as the first time the seasoning was too strong to me.
