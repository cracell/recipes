Tried with 6 pieces of thick cut deli bacon. Yield 1/4 cup lard.

Cook bacon as you would normally. Wait until bacon grease cools and then pour through a cheesecloth into a glass container. Using a plastic container will be much harder to clean.

Cover and lard should keep for a week in the fridge.
