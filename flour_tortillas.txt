2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup lard, or vegetable shortening
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup warm milk, or water

1. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl.  Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Add the lard and mix until it is well combined and the mixture looks grainy.
3. Add the warm milk and mix until a smooth ball of dough forms, about 5 minutes.
4 Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll the pieces into balls. 
Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
5. Once rested, roll the balls of dough into 6″ to 7″ tortillas. 
6. Cook on a griddle, or in a heavy pan, over medium heat until golden brown and puffy.
7. Transfer to a plate and cover with a towel while the rest cook.
Enjoy!  Or, allow them to cool and store them in a plastic bag in the fridge.  They last for five days ... if you can keep from eating them hot off the griddle.


Tip: (From source) Much better with lard and milk over shortening and water
Tip: (From me) Using a pastry blender to work in the lard seems to work well
Tip: (From me) Dividing it into 12 made very tiny tortillas.

Reddit tips "These come out really tasty but the trick is in the details. The first thing is to put the dough in saran wrap and let it sit in the fridge overnight. This just lets the dough setup and bond the flavors together better. If you don't the tortillas tend to come out a bit floury tasting.
The next thing is how you roll them. You must roll them very thin. Thinner than you would think, basically as thin as you can get it with a rolling pin.
When you cook them in your pan (try a thick bottom cast iron if you can) don't use any fat in the pan as it's already in the dough. Heat up the pan first and then cook the tortillas on med to med high depending on your pan. If you rolled them out thin enough they will puff up and will cook quickly so don't leave them."
