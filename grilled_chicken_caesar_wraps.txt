1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Butterfly chicken...if needed? To desired thickness?
Combine 2 tablespoons dressing and chicken in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Marinate in refrigerator 45 minutes, turning bag occasionally.

1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 10 ounces)
2 tablespoons light Caesar salad dressing
4 whole leaves Romaine lettuce
4 small (1 ounce each) whole-wheat sandwich wraps
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Slice chicken breast partly through its center and open like a book, or butterfly. Place in a resealable bag. Add dressing and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, up to overnight. Preheat grill to medium-high. Grill chicken until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Move to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then cut into bite-size strips. Cut the rib stalk away from each lettuce leave, so the leaf rolls without breaking. Place two leaf halves on each wrap. Sprinkle with cheese. Place chicken at the bottom of the wrap and roll up. Secure with toothpicks and cut into pieces. Serve with more dressing to dip, if desired.
