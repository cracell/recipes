Turkey Notes


A turkey oven bag != brine bag. Due to this the brine did not completely submerge the turkey and the turkey had to be turned. This may be why the brine wasn't all that strong of a flavour in a lot of the meat.

Need two boxes of stuffing to have extra for sandwiches the next day.


Gravy

Had lots of drippings so just boiled them down and added some butter and a corn starch roux, made very yummy gravy.
