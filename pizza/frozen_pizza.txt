Frozen Pizza


Partially bake the pizza crust for 3-4 minutes. Make sure it gets it's shape and dry but no browning.

Assemble pizza on top of partially baked crust once it's cool.

Vacuum pack whole pizza.


To bake, preheat oven to 425ÂºF. Transfer frozen pizza to a pizza pan or baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and starts to brown.

Candle's cooking at 425, was still cool in center after 10 minutes but good on the outside. Perhaps a lower heat and longer? Or thinner pizza like Mr. Pizzas style

Thicker pizza 22-30 minutes at 350f
