# Low Moisture Pizza Dough
## Servings
3 personal pizzas

## Difficulty
Easy for a yeast bread


## Ingredients
- 7.5 grams (2 teaspoons) active dry yeast or instant yeast
- 218 grams (1 cup) lukewarm water
- 8 grams, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 8.7 grams (2 teaspoons) sugar
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- 13.4 grams (1 tablespoon) olive oil
- 375 grams (3 cups) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

1. If you're using active dry yeast, dissolve it, with a pinch of sugar, in 2 tablespoons of the 100F - 110F water. Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you're using instant yeast, you can skip this step.

1. Combine the dissolved yeast (or the instant yeast) with the remainder of the ingredients. 

1. Let dough rest for 5 minutes after to hydrate the gluten

1. Mix and knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—till you've made a soft, smooth dough. If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 9 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.

1. Divide dough into 3 balls and place into 3 lightly greased containers with enough room for dough to double. Cover the containers.

1. To make pizza now: Allow it to rise at room temperature till it's very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry. If it takes longer, that's OK; just give it some extra time.

1. To make pizza later: Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 48 hours, which gives this dought the best flavour); it will rise slowly as it chills. This step allows you more schedule flexibility; it also develops the crust's flavor. About 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator.

1. If you're making a rectangular pizza, shape the dough into a rough oval. For a round pizza, shape it into a rough circle. In either case, don't pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape. Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.


1. Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice. Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s). The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch.

1. Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (if it hasn't been refrigerated); or 2 to 2 1/2 hours (if it's been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, place a cast iron pan on the top rack (to crisp up cheese) but don't use a baking stone (moisture level is too low for it). Then peheat the oven to 450°F.

1. Add your toppings and then press lightly down on the pizza like a sandwich to get the toppings nice and tight together.

1. Cook for about 9 minutes. Don't overcook this crust, it's ready when the edges started looking golden.




## Tips
- Don't knead in very much flour. Keep the dough as moist as you can while still being able to knead it.
- Make dough before for best results
- Unbleached flour is suppose to be better (due to having beta-carotene)
- Can be frozen after it's risen in the fridge for a day
