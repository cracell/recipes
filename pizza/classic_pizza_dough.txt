2 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
2 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter
7/8 to 1 1/8 cups lukewarm water*
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt




1) If you're using active dry yeast, dissolve it, with a pinch of sugar, in 2 tablespoons of the 100F - 110F water. Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you're using instant yeast, you can skip this step.
2) Combine the dissolved yeast (or the instant yeast) with the remainder of the ingredients. Mix and knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—till you've made a soft, smooth dough. If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.
4) To make pizza now: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it's very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry. If it takes longer, that's OK; just give it some extra time.
5) To make pizza later: Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 24 hours); it will rise slowly as it chills. This step allows you more schedule flexibility; it also develops the crust's flavor. About 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator.
Two 1/2"-thick 14" round pizzas (pictured); 
Two 3/4"-thick 12" round pizzas; 
One 3/4" to 1"-thick 13" x 18" rectangular (Sicilian-style) pizza (pictured); 
One 1 1/2"-thick 9" x 13" rectangular pizza; 
One 1"-thick 14" round pizza.
7) Divide the dough in half, for two pizzas; or leave it whole for one pizza.
8) If you're making a rectangular pizza, shape the dough into a rough oval. For a round pizza, shape it into a rough circle. In either case, don't pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape. Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.
9) Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice. Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s). The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch.
12) Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (if it hasn't been refrigerated); or 2 to 2 1/2 hours (if it's been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

Notes from the last time we made this recipe: 
Too much oil in it.
More flour but not as much as usual - Don't knead in lots of it, if it's sticky while kneading dip hands in room temperature water and pat dry.
Wetting hands while kneading works well
Let dough rest after initial mixing to hydrate the gluten
Night before for best results
Split this one into thirds not halves
Unbleached flour is suppose to be better (due to having beta-carotene)
