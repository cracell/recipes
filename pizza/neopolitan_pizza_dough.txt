Neopolitan Pizza Dough

7.5 cups all purpose flour
3 cups lukewarm water
1 tablespoon yeast
1 tablespoon seasalt
Pour the floor flour into a bowl and make a well
Add the yeast and salt to the lukewarm water and stir until dissolved
Pour the water in the well and mix until evenly incorporated - do not kneed! This dough is intended to be light and airy and is based off of the Neopolitan style of dough.
The dough will have a slightly moist consistency, not smooth and springy like bread dough. Cover with a damp towel and leave in a warm place for two hours.
The down can then be frozen or left covered in the fridge for up to two weeks. I prefer leaving the dough in the freezer as it begins to develop and amazing sour-dough quality.


Made once for a deep dish. Rose on counter for 2 hours and sat in fridge for 2 days. Came out with a very nice flavour, somewhat bread like, did not knead or dough hook for very long. Was way too much for my cast iron pan size wise. Could've been split into 3 individual pizzas or so.
