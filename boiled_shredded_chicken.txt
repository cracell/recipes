Boiled Shredded Chicken

Garlic cut into small chunks
chicken
1 teaspoon onion powder
pinch of salt

1. Combine all ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a boil, skimming surface as needed until foam subsides.
2. Barely simmer over lowest heat, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. (You can check that the chicken is cooked through by trying to seperate it with a fork)
3. Remove chicken, set aside, and strain broth. Set broth aside.
4. When chicken is cool enough to handle, shred meat.
