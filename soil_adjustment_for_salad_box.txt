Soil


Tested my Mel's Mix and the ph is at least 7.5. Want to lower it to 6.5. 

Iron Sulfate and Aluminum sulfate lower ph.

Need to add .2 of a pound of Aluminum sulfate


Other tests (on 72 hour old soil water mix)

K Test (Potash)

K3 Sufficient

Phosporus test
P4 Surplus



Nitrogen test


N- depleted (may have simply evaporated)





Based on these tests and other reading instead of directly altering Ph I want to try adding addition composts and testing with lettuce.
