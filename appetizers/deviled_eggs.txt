Deviled Eggs

6 eggs boiled and peeled
1/4 tsp salt
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/4 tsp ground pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon cayenne (maybe less)
paprika
pinch of sugar
bacon crumbled to put on top

1. Cut peeled eggs lengthwise in half.
2. Slip out yolks into bowl.
3. Mash with fork.
4. Mix in ingredients.
5. Fill whites with egg yolk mixture, heaping it up lightly.
6. Sprinkle paprika oven it.


Tips: Put cooked egg yolks in a zip lock bag. Seal, mash till they are all broken up. Add remainder of ingredients, reseal, keep mashing it up mixing thoroughly, cut the tip of the baggy, squeeze mixture into egg. Just throw bag away when done easy clean up. (I have not tried this yet) - This worked ok. I think a fork in a bowl is faster.
