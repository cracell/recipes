Notes: Made this one time and halved it (only put in one egg). Did not have whole wheat flour but it came out well.

Notes from last time: Made it with the buttermilk and whole wheat flour. Didn't taste as eggy or sweet which I missed. I credit this to the whole wheat flour covering up some of the egg and sugar taste.


Notes from another time making it: Used whole-wheat flour, 1 3/4 cups of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Came out quite nice. DON'T STIR IS TOO MUCH.
