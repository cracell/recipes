Fried Chicken Research

Night before

2 pounds of chicken
1 tablespoon salt
enough buttermilk to cover chicken
paprika
cayenne
garlic powder
onion powder

Soak chicken in baggy with enough buttermilk to cover. Add generous amounts of salt to the buttermilk





possible seasonings
parsley, tarragon, thyme, chili powder, freshly ground peppers, pepper, celery seed, rosemary, sugar (with the buttermilk marinade), ginger, marjoram, savory, white pepper, tellicherry pepper, coriander, cumin, cardamom, allspice, cloves, sage


Can dredge chicken in flour. Or shake up in a bag. Mix seasonings with flour.


Some suggest peanut oil and cooking in a cast iron skillet with 2 cups of oil.


For oil use peanut oil or grape seed oil. You want a high smoke point oil.


Some use bread crumbs or saltines.


DO THIS!
Do this and I promise you will love the results.
First, soak the chicken overnight in salted buttermilk. The combination makes for wonderfully juicy, tender, flavorful meat under that crunchy crust.
Combine flour with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, fresh ground white pepper, a couple tbsp of cornstarch, and salt. (use a tsp each per cup of flour). Put it in a ziploc. Add chicken, straight from the marinade, into the baggie with the flour, 1 or 2 pieces at a time. Toss to coat, then remove to a wire rack and allow to set 15 minutes. Do not skip this step, it will ensure the coating stays on the chicken.
Now, if you're brave, lard is the absolute best medium for frying the chicken. I can't stress this enough, everything else will be a distant second. If you can't or won't use lard, though, shortening is better than oil for crispness. Heat oil to 325 degrees F, and fry chicken 10-12 min per side. Don't overcrowd the pan. Drain on the wire rack or paper bags/towels. Pour most of the fat from the pan and use the drippings and the seasoned flour to make cream gravy.

Reply
My suggestion would be to omit the onion power and paprika from the flour. Instead season the chicken with them prior to the flour. Paprika can burn under high heat, this will keep it safe and tasty under the flour.
Oh and i'd skip the gravy, but thats just me.
