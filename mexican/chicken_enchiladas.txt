Chicken Enchiladas

4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves cooked and shredded (use another recipe for this)
1 onion, chopped
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 can (10 oz) La Preferida Enchilada Sauce (Hot or Mild) 
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
3 clove garlic, minced
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (12 ounce) jar taco sauce
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 jalapeno chopped finely

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

2. Add chicken to a large high skillet. Add the onion, sour cream, jalapeno, Cheddar cheese, parsley, oregano and ground black pepper. Heat until cheese melts. 

3. Stir in salt, half of enchilada sauce, chili powder, cayenne, green pepper, cilantro and garlic.

4. Roll even amounts of the mixture in the tortillas. Arrange in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with taco sauce and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.

Add some Cilantro on top. And olives on half (only half for Candle :) )
