Tortillas (makes 8)

2 cups all-purpose flour (250 grams)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (11 grams)
1 teaspoon salt (6.5 grams)
10 small grains L-cysteine (optional) (Should be 0.01% of total flour weight)
2 teaspoons (8 grams) olive oil (or butter? hmm)
1 cup (240 grams) near boiling milk/3/4 cup near boiling water


1. Sift dry ingredients into bowl and mix.
2. Mix oil into dry ingredients
3. Boil milk uncovered. Watch it closely to prevent it from overflowing once it boils, it happens fast.
4. Once milk is just boiling, add to dry ingredients in bowl.
4. Mix with butter knife.
5. Knead until well mixed.
6. Let set for 15-20 minutes
7. Tear golf ball sized bit of dough away
8. Roll out with lots of flour on the surface and rolling pin.
9. Cook tortillas in a cast iron skillet as close to the highest heat with no oil.


Tips: Tortillas freeze well. Wrap tightly in plastic, removing any air pockets. Keeps frozen for several weeks.

Note: With water they taste like traditional tortillas. With milk they are fluffier and a bit more flavourful.


Idea: Try steam cooking one. Or some suggest just putting a lid over the pan. - http://testkitchentuesday.com/2011/03/08/tuesday-tip-steaming-tortillas-without-a-steamer/
