Tried once. Was good but the spices seemed off. Too much cinammon and orange. Not sure what it needs. More pepper maybe?


Tried again with new spices (see chili oregano, ground coriander, cumin and pepper) Also did the spice rub several hours before. And used lime instead of an orange and did not put the lime pieces into the pork dish.




Don't add coriander
