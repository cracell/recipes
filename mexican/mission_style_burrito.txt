Results: Closest yet but not quite there.

Carnitas seemed a tad overcooked and could use additional grease. Rice was good but needed more spices perhaps no pice de gallo. I would guess cumin, coarder. twice as much cayenne. Tortillas needed to be much larger (huge!) and steamed somehow. The guacamole from the mexican salsa people did not work well. If putting in oven put in at 350 for 10 minutes. 

Frying rice + chicken stock instead of water was a huge improvement.
