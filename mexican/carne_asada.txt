Carne Asada 2

Marinade 2 (for 2.5 pounds of meat) [Props go out to Reddit! Pibil especially.]:

4-6 cloves garlic
1 jalapeno
entire bushel of cilantro
1 cup olive oil
6 limes
1 orange juiced
1 sliced large white onion
lots of kosher salt
black pepper
white pepper
cumin
Mexican Oregano
Hungarian Hot Paprika
Cayenne Pepper Powder
Cinnamon
1/2 cup soy sauce

I blended everything in a food processor, then marinated the meat for 5 hours. Cooked it on a grill at 450 for 6 minutes on each side, came out mostly medium, with one steak at medium-rare.
