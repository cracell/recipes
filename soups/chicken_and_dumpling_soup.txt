Chicken and Dumplings Soup

Soup Ingredients
2 Tablespoons Butter
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1/2 cup All-purpose Flour
1 whole Chicken, Cut Into Pieces (cut Up Fryer)
Salt And Pepper
1 cup Diced Carrots
1 cup Diced Celery
1 whole Medium Onion, Finely Diced
1/2 teaspoon Ground Thyme
1/4 teaspoon Turmeric
6 cups (48oz) Low Sodium Chicken Broth
1/2 cup Apple Cider (or Apple Juice)
1/2 cup Heavy Cream

Dumpling Ingredients
2 large eggs
1/3 cup milk
2 large egg yolks
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for salting dumpling water
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cups flour

1. Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then dredge both sides in flour.

2. Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat. In two batches, brown chicken on both sides and remove to a clean plate.

3. In the same pot, add diced onion, carrots, and celery. Stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes over medium-low heat. Stir in ground thyme and turmeric, then pour in chicken broth and apple cider. Stir to combine, then add browned chicken. Cover pot and simmer for 20 minutes.

4. While broth is simmering, make dumplings. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Mix eggs, milk, egg yolks, butter, parsley, salt and pepper together until well-blended. Stir in flour (batter will be soft). Drop teaspoonfuls of the dumpling batter to the boiling water until tender, about 8 minutes. 

5. Remove chicken from pot and set aside on a plate.

6. Transfer dumplings to broth pot.

7. Use two forks to remove chicken from the bone. Shred, then add chicken to the pot. 

8. Pour heavy cream into the pot and stir to combine.

9. Add minced parsley if using. Cover pot halfway and continue to simmer for 15 minutes. Check seasonings; add salt if needed. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

Idea for dumplings: use premade biscuit dough.

Should have it next time.

Tried dumplings from the pioneer woman recipe. Use less liquid so you can handle the dough and roll with hands into balls.
