Cook Time: 1 hour

Ingredients:


1/4 pound salt pork, cut in 1-inch strips, or about 5 to 6 slices bacon, diced
1 large onion, cut in 1-inch chunks
4 to 6 green onions, sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons flour
2 bay leaves or 1 lime tree leaves
1 sprig fresh or 1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 pounds peeled potatoes, cut in 1-inch chunks (red, yellow, or variety)
3 cups chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon pepper
sweet ground paprika, optional
oregano (fresh would be better)
marjoram
garlic
carrots
celery
half a package of cream cheese
sour dough breadbowls for serving
Hot pepper halved and seeded for spiciness/flavouring

Preparation:

1. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, cook the salt pork or bacon until crisp. 
2. Add onions and cook until they soften somewhat, about 4 or 5 minutes. 
3. Sprinkle flour over the onions, add bay leaves and thyme; increase the heat to high. Pour in wine and stir to loosen brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until wine has evaporated.
4. Add potatoes, broth, and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 45 to 60 minutes. Sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings. Remove bay leaves before serving.
Serves 3 to 4.



Try adding a jalapeno and using cream cheese instead of cream.

Also a lime tree leaf or two instead of bay leaves? Take them from a branch you plan to prune to make two batches from.
