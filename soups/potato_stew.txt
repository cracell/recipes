Cook Time: 1 hour

Ingredients:


1/4 pound salt pork, cut in 1-inch strips, or about 5 to 6 slices bacon, diced
1 large onion, cut in 1-inch chunks
4 to 6 green onions, sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons flour
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 pounds potatoes, cut in 1-inch chunks (red, yellow, or variety)
3 cups chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon pepper
sweet ground paprika, optional
oregano
garlic
carrots
celery
cream
Preparation:

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, cook the salt pork or bacon until crisp. Add onions and cook until they soften somewhat, about 4 or 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the onions, add bay leaves and thyme; increase the heat to high. Pour in wine and stir to loosen brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until wine has evaporated.
Add potatoes, broth, and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 45 to 60 minutes. Sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings. Remove bay leaves before serving.
Serves 3 to 4.
