Jack Burger Glaze

1 cup water
1 ½ cups pineapple juice
⅓ cup Teriyaki sauce
1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
2 cups brown sugar
¼ cup lemon juice
¼ cup white onion, finely minced
3 tablespoons Jack Daniels Whiskey
3 tablespoons minced garlic
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper



1. In a large saucepan over medium/high heat, combine the water, pineapple juice, Teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and then immediately reduce to a simmer.
Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine.
2. Let the mixture simmer for about an hour, or until it becomes syrupy and reduces by half. Don’t turn up the heat, low heat is key to making the perfect glaze without burning the sugar.

Notes from first time making:

Pretty good. Good on the bun too. Don't overcook it, gets much thicker when cooled. Could have made half as much last time and would have been plenty.
