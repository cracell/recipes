Chashu

1-2lb pork loin roast (or pork belly or marble pork cheeks)
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup sake
1 cup mirin
1/2 cup sugar
6 scallions (green onions), roughly chopped
6 whole garlic cloves smashed
One 2-inch knob ginger, roughly sliced
1 whole shallot, split in half (skin on)
water (amount varies)



1. Cut roast into 3 or 4 long pieces. Or some how chunk it. You want a lot of surface area for the broth to sink into but you also want it big enough that you can thinly slice it when it's done.

2. Add roast to pot with all ingredients. Add water until the roast is covered.

3. Cover pot and bring to a simmer. Simmer for several hours until a fork easily passes through meat but before it starts to fall apart. Allow pork to cool in the braising liquid then remove the meat from the liquid. Wrap in plastic and chilli in the refrigrator. This makes it easier to slice thinly.

4. Slice the pork against the grain and serve on top of ramen. (The heat form the soup will warm it up). Also is great on top of rice with a little of the braising liquid drizzled on top.
