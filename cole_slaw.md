# Cole Slaw

## Ingredients
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup mayo
- 1/4 teaspoon celery seed (optional, but AWESOME)
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 bag shredded cabbage.

## Instructions
1. Add the sugar and the vinegar into a bowl and whisk together until the sugar dissolves, 1 minute. Then add the mayo and some salt and pepper. Whisk again until smooth and creamy.
1. Toss 3/4 of the dressing with the cabbage in a large bowl.  Then see if you need more dressing for your taste. (I usually add all of it). Taste some cabbage and see if you need more salt or pepper.

## Variations 
- Add a teaspoon (or more) of Trader Joeâ€™s Taco seasoning for a SW coleslaw
- Add grated apples or sliced celery to the cabbage
- Add grated carrots or sliced sweet onions to cabbage for color and sweetness

## Ideas
- Use greek yogurt instead of mayo
