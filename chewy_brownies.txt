Notes from first time making it.

Stuck to the bottom of the 9x13 pan a lot, should've been sprayed or need oil added to the brownies maybe. Also a bit thin, I think this recipe would work fine in a 9x9 pan. Perhaps needing a little more cooking time. Personally it wasn't quite chewy enough for me but Candle loved the above and rated it above box brownies.
