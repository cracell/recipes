New York Style Pizza Dough

22.5 ounces (638 grams, about 4 1/2 cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting
.5 ounces (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) sugar
.35 ounces kosher salt (about 1 tablespoon)
.35 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) instant yeast
1.125 ounces Extra Virgin olive oil (about 3 tablespoons)
15 ounces (427 grams) lukewarm water


1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times until incorporated. Add olive oil and water. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.

2. Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed. It should pass the windowpane test. Divide dough into three even parts and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5. Remove from refrigerator, shape into balls, and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.


Ratios
All-purpose or bread flour: 100%
Sugar: 2%
Salt: 1.5%
Instant yeast: 1.5 %
Olive oil: 5%
Water: 67%


Todo: When we get a more sensitive scale redo measurements based on the ratios



Notes: Tried this, filled up food processor and it did not form a ball. Dough was very hard to handle, ended up "plopping" it into containers. Water ratio may be off. Sugar seems unnecessary, and seems like hand mixing it would work at well. Though perhaps just need to reduce ratios for my food processor.


ideas: I loved this recipe, but found it was even more amazing if I replaced plain water with a mixture of 6ozs of plain Greek Yogurt and 9ozs of water. You may need to add adjust the flour, but it made for an great crust!

Tip: When removing try to let the dough's weight remove itself (by tipping the container)
