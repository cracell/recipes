Chicago Style Pizza Sauce
2 tbsp unsalted butter
¼ cup grated onion , from 1 medium onion (see note below)
¼ tsp dried oregano
Table salt
3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
1 (28-oz) can crushed tomatoes
¼ tsp sugar
2 tbsp coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Ground black pepper

Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until melted. Then add the onion, oregano, crushed red pepper and ½ teaspoon of salt, cooking and stirring occasionally until liquid has evaporated and onion is golden brown -- about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant -- about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes and sugar, increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium-low and continue simmering until the sauce has reduced to 2½ cups, about 35-30 minutes. Remove the sauce from the stove and stir in basil and oil. Season with salt and pepper, taste and adjust as needed.
