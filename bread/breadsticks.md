## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup warm water (105 F)
- 363.4 grams (combine both water)
- 7.1 grams 1 package (.25 oz) active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 570 grams - 4 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus more if needed
- 2 TB butter, softened (not melted)
- 26.7 grams - 2 TB white sugar
- 19.8 grams - 1 TB fine salt
- 1 1/4 cups + 2 TB warm water
- oil spray

## Topping
- 4 TB melted butter
- 1/2 tsp coarse kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- pinches of grated Parmesan cheese
- pinches of dried oregano

## Directions
1. Sprinkle yeast into 1/4 cup warm water.  Let sit about 10 minutes, until foamy. 
1. Slowly add flour, butter, sugar, fine salt, and warm water (1 1/4 cups + 2 TB).  Mix until dough forms. Dough should be just a little bit sticky, but still able to form a ball.  If needed, add a little bit of flour at a time until your dough reaches right consistency.
1. Knead dough by hand on lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until dough gets smooth and soft.  
1. Roll dough into a 2-foot log. 
1. With sharp knife, cut into 16 even pieces. Keep pieces covered with cloth.  
1. Knead each piece slightly and shape into 7-inch long breadstick.  
1. Place breadsticks 2 in. apart on parchment-lined baking sheet.  
1. Spray each piece with oil and cover with cloth.  
1. Let rise in draft-free, warm spot until doubled.  About 45 min to 1 hour. (30 minutes if you are refrigerating them overnight)
1. If refrigerated, pull breadsticks out 3 hours before baking so they can warm up to room temperature.
1. Preheat oven to 400F.  Brush breadsticks with half of the melted butter and sprinkle with kosher salt evenly. 
1. Bake on upper middle rack until lightly golden, about 10-14 minutes.  Watch closely to prevent over browning.
1. With breadsticks still hot on parchment-lined sheet, brush with remaining melted butter.  Sprinkle evenly with garlic, parmesan, and oregano.
1. Serve up while still warm!

Notes: Can be frozen after a slow rise in the fridge (overnight). Are more chewy that way.
Don't overcook. You want them chewy on the inside. Remove from oven when a bit golden brown on the edges.
