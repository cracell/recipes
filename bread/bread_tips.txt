Bread Tips
- Don't add too much flour when kneading
- Before kneading let the dough rest for 5 minutes to hydrate (this may be a myth but I think it works)
- Put a dish of water into the oven while preheating and during baking to increase the humidity during baking. This seems to improve the texture and taste of the crust.
