Bread Tips
- Don't add too much flour when kneading
- Before kneading let the dough rest for 5 minutes to hydrate (this may be a myth but I think it works)
- Put a dish of water into the oven while preheating and during baking to increase the humidity during baking. This seems to improve the texture and taste of the crust.
- Seems like bread that sits in the fridge for over 2 days becomes a bit too bubbling in places and the dough isn't as good. I think it depends on the particular dough but most are best with just a 1 or 2 day cold fermentation.
