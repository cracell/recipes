White Sandwich Bread

303g lukewarm water*
32g honey
2 1/4 teaspoons (8 grams) instant yeast
1 3/4 teaspoons salt (10.2 grams)
28g soft butter
482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk granules

1) Mix all of the ingredients in the order listed, and mix and knead — by hand, or using a stand mixer — to make a smooth dough. It won't be particularly soft nor stiff; it should be smooth and feel bouncy and elastic under your hands.

2) Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, or large (8-cup) measuring cup. Cover it, and let it rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's become quite puffy, though not necessarily doubled in size.

3) Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a fat 9" log. Place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.

4) Cover the pan, and let the dough rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's crowned 1" to 1 1/2" over the rim of the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.

5) Bake the bread for 20 minutes. Tent it lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, till it's golden brown. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 195°F to 200°F.

6) Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a rack to cool. When completely cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature.

Yield: 1 large loaf, about 18 servings.


First time making used low amount of water. Had to knead in some flour while kneading to keep it from sticking too much.

Cooked for full first stage, but cooked the second stage for only 10 minutes. (as opposed to the 15-20 in the instructions) (maybe my oven runs hot?)
