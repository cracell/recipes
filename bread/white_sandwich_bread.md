White Sandwich Bread

- 303g lukewarm water*
- 32g honey
- 2 1/4 teaspoons (8 grams) instant yeast
- 1 3/4 teaspoons (10.2 grams) salt
- 28g soft butter
- 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk granules
- 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

1. Mix all of the ingredients in the order listed, and mix and knead — by hand, or using a stand mixer — to make a smooth dough. It won't be particularly soft nor stiff; it should be smooth and feel bouncy and elastic under your hands.
2. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, or large (8-cup) measuring cup. Cover it, and let it rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's become quite puffy, though not necessarily doubled in size.
3. Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a fat 9" log. Place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.
4. Cover the pan, and let the dough rise for 60 to 90 minutes, till it's crowned 1" to 1 1/2" over the rim of the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.
5. Bake the bread for 20 minutes. 
6. Tent it lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 5 to 20 minutes, till it's golden brown. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 195°F to 200°F.
7. Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a rack to cool. When completely cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature.

Yield: 1 large loaf, about 18 servings.

For Long Term storage: Let dough rise at room temperature, then freeze instead of putting in loaf pan. Defrost overnight in refridge and then put in loaf pan and cook once risen.



Trying as baguettes.

Split into two torpedos. Cook at 425 for 20 minutes until crust is golden brown. Add in water to bottom of oven during preheat. And have baguettes cool in warm oven with door cracked open. (Using cooking instructions from http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/french-baguettes-recipe)

Tried as baguettes, bread inside was same loaves. Works much better as a loaf.
