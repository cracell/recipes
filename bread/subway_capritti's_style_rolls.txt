Subway/Capritti's Style Rolls

Soft White Roll

Servings: Six sandwich rolls

This recipe approximates the quintessential white sandwich roll found throughout the Bay Area. The recipe is simple, quick, and addictive.

Ingredients

11.4 grams - 1 tablespoon (1 packet) (15 ml) (7 gm/ ¼ oz) active dry yeast
52.4 grams - ¼ cup (60 ml) warm water (105-110º F) (41-43°C) (No need to use a thermometer – it should feel between lukewarm and hot to the touch).
237.4 grams - 1 cup (240 ml) warm milk (105-110º F) (41-43°C) (We’ve tried both nonfat and 2%, with no noticeable difference)
1½ tablespoons (22½ ml) (20 gm/ ⅔ oz) sugar
22.4 grams - 2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil (plus additional olive or vegetable oil for greasing bowl during rising)
9.5 grams - 1½ teaspoons (7½ ml) (9 gm/⅓ oz) salt
Up to 4 cups (960 ml) (600 gm/21oz) all purpose flour

Directions:

1.	In the bowl of an electric mixer or large mixing bowl, combine yeast, water, milk and sugar. Stir to dissolve and let sit for about 5 minutes (The mixture should start to bubble or foam a bit and smell yeasty).
2.	Add in vegetable oil, salt and 2 cups of flour. Using the dough hook attachment or a wooden spoon, mix at medium speed until the dough comes together. (The photo to below is with the first 250 grams - 2 cups of flour added).
3.	Add remaining flour a 32 grams - quarter cup at time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, as shown in the photo below (For us, this usually required an additional 1½ to 2 cups of flour).
4.	Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 4 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
5.	Place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 
6. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled (or more) in size (see photo comparison).
6.	Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 3 equal portions (using a sharp knife or a dough scraper works well). Shape each into a ball or loaf and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet (try not to handle the dough too much at this point).
7.	Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 15 minutes while you prepare the topping.
8.	Coat the top of each roll or loaf with the topping as described above. While the original recipe recommends letting them stand for 20 minutes after applying the topping, I got better results by putting them directly into the oven.
9.	Once you’ve applied the topping, bake in a preheated moderately hot 380ºF/190°C/gas mark 5 for 25-30 minutes, until well browned. Let cool completely on a wire rack before eating.


Notes: from making for first time. Baguette pan did not work well. Puffed up way too much. Divided into 3 rolls. Seems to be the right split, be sure to shape them pretty flatly though as they will puff up.

Sounds like they might work...pretty basic italian style recipe.



This thread http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/1727/italian-hero-sandwich-rolls also contains a very traditional italian recipe. We might even be able to adapt the italian baguette recipe...but maybe not.




Should try this dough for deep dish pizza. With a nice and hearty sauce. Maybe using those sweet Italian tomatos...
