Tips: Before using on burgers, spread Rendered beef suet on them and toast on grill.

Tip: For a tenderbun, use White Lily bread flour, which is made from soft wheat and milled to produce a minimum of damaged starch. Aficionados of Southern biscuits swear by this brand, but other soft wheat pastry flours may be used instead. If substituting all-purpose flour, use a little more water when making the dough. The buns will be chewy and tougher but still presentable
