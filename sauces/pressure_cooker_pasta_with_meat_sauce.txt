Pressure Cooker Pasta with Meat Sauce

Noodles (used Penne) were too thick needed longer cooking time or thinner noodles

Oregano and majoram flavours were largely damaged by the pressure cooking. Should add after the pressure subsides.

lots of garlic is fine. Makes twice as much as is needed. Could freeze and save half in a casserole of sorts.

Worked great with Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage
