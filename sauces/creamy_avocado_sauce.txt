Creamy Avocado Sauce for Pasta

2 medium sized ripe Avocado, pitted
1/4 cup lemon juice + lemon zest to garnish
5 garlic cloves, to taste
1 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
~1/2 cup Fresh Basil, (optional)
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

4 servings/12 oz of your choice of pasta (I used 3oz of spelt and 3 oz of Kamut spaghetti)
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste


1. Make the sauce by placing the garlic cloves, lemon juice, and olive oil into a food processor. Process until smooth. 
2. Now add in the pitted avocado, basil, and salt. Process until smooth and creamy.


Note: This dish does not reheat well due to the avocado in the sauce. Please serve immediately. (idea, keep some of the sauce cold and seperate if leftover?)
