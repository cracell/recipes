Spicy BBQ Sauce

1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cups tomato sauce
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/8 cup vegetable oil (2 tablespoons)
1/8 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoon honey
1/8 cup lemon juice
3/4 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne spicy
1 teaspoon salt

1. Combine all ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil.

2. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 10-15 minutes.

3. Pour sauce through strainer to remove onion and garlic. (Do I need to do this?)

5. Adjust seasoning as needed.

6. Let cool, then refrigerate for a couple of hours.

Notes from first time making: Was too much like a spaghetti sauce. Blended the onion and jalapeno into it which was a bad idea. The distinct jalapeno flavour in it didn't fit either.
