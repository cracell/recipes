Stir Fry

1st time making it
1 green bell pepper sliced thinly
1 red bell pepper sliced thinly
half of a red onion sliced thinly
asparagus chopped
2 serrano peppers
Trader Joe's General Tao Stir Fry sauce
1 pound boneless beef sirloin steak, 3/4 inch thick

Cooked beef first. Then set aside and cooked vegetables in a little oil. Then added the beef back in and added the sauce in.

Overall it came out decent. I used too much sauce, it should be just enough to cover stuff but not drench. And chopping the asparagus made it too small, it should be in large pieces. The serrano was also too small. I think just putting the spiciness in the sauce makes more sense.
