1. Make dough according to recipe, ensure it is not so sticky that you can't work with it and it sticks to everything

2. Set down on a well floured surface and gather the dough into a pile.

3. Press the heels of your hands firmly into the dough, pushing forward slightly.

4. Fold the far edge of the dough upwards, towards you, and press it into the middle of the ball. Rotate it slightly, too. Repeat this press-fold-turn sequence for the duration of the kneading process.

Pinch the dough to see if you're done. Bread dough will become firmer as you knead it, just as winding a spring makes more winding harder. Pinch a bit of dough between your fingers. If it's ready, it will feel like an earlobe. If in doubt, knead a little longer.


Tips: Time your kneading, especially if the recipe suggests a time. 20 minutes can seem like a long time doing the same repetitive activity. Don't cut it short.
