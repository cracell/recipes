Sous Vide Steak

First attempt. Used dutch oven for water bath. Target temperature of 135 with +/- 2 degrees of tolerance.

Stayed in target range but had to adjust every 5 minutes or so. Non-ideal.

Steak came out the best I've made before. Majoram seemed unnecessary and more thyme and no garlic. So next time just thyme, pepper, salt.

Blow-torch for searing didn't work. Blow-torch I got didn't work at an angle, need to get one with pressure regulation.


Next time target temp should be 138 +/- 2. Not sure how to make the temperature easier to control
