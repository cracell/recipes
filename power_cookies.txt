Power Cookies
YIELD: MAKES ABOUT 20 TO 22 COOKIES, DEPENDING ON YOUR SCOOP TOTAL TIME: 45 MINTUES
ingredients:
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 1/2 cups (185grams) unbleached organic all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons (37.5 grams) brewers yeast
3 tablespoons (18 grams) ground flaxseed
1/2 teaspoon (1.9 grams) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (2.3 grams) baking soda
1/2 teaspoon (1 grams) ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon (1.4 grams) salt
12 tablespoons organic unsalted butter
1/4 cup (57.6 grams) unrefined organic virgin coconut oil
1 1/2 cups (320 grams) organic cane sugar (they are too sweet, try reducing to 1 cup)
1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups raisins

feel free to add: unsweetened flaked coconut, chopped almonds, 1 to 2 tablespoons of almond butter
2 tablespoons chia seeds

directions:

1. Preheat the oven the 350 degrees F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, yeast, flaxseed, baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.
3. In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut oil on medium speed until creamy. 
4. Add in the sugar and beat on medium to high spee until fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. 
5. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
6. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until combined again. 
7. Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating on low speed until just combined and mixed. 
8. Stir in the raisins with a spatula until they are evenly dispersed.
9. Scoop the dough into 1-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are fairly uniform in size) and place on a baking sheet about 2 inches apart. 
10. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes, or until the bottoms are just golden. Let cool completely before storing in a sealed container. They stay chewy when you don't overcook them.

1. You can easily freeze this dough - scoop the rounds on a baking sheet, place the sheet in the freezer for 2 hours, then place the dough rounds in a ziplock bag and store in the freezer. Bake at the same temp - they may or may not need an extra minute or 2 - your preference!
2. You can use all butter if you don't have/can't find coconut oil. If you swap any butter amount for more coconut oil, the cookies will spread a bit more. If you decrease the fat (butter/oil) amount in total, these cookies will be drier. It's up to you!
3. You can use 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour with similar results - any more and the cookies with be drier and grittier.
4. You can probably decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup without issue.
5. I do not have experience in making these vegan, so I can't say what it would be like without the eggs or with vegan butter. I also am not sure how the consistency would be with gluten free flour.
6. I personally think you can increase the brewers yeast amount by 1 to 2 tablespoons.

Weights came from uncalibrated scale. Disagreed with wolfram alpha numbers. hmm.
