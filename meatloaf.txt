Meatloaf

 Meatloaf:
1 cup Whole Milk
6 slices White Bread or 6-10 crackers
2 pounds Ground Beef
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese (or cheddar)
1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
3/4 teaspoons Salt
 Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
2 whole Eggs, Beaten
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
(try with 1/3 cup Brown Sugar)
(could add some bbq and less milk too)
 

 Sauce:
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain. (Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!)
Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together. Pour 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the bacon. Spread with a spoon.
Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes. Slice and serve with remaining sauce.
Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!

Used one sleeve of saltines instead of bread and had to wing the seasoning salt combo. Came out decent but probably had too many crackers and the seasoning could be better. I quite liked the sauce though.



2 tablespoons salt
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch
