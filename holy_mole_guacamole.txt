Ingredients
2 ripe avocados
1 lime
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard
2 clove of garlic
1 1/2 minced jalapeno or serrano pepper (or try a hot sauce)
1 chopped shallot
3/4 teaspoon of olive oil
3/4 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper to taste
2-3 drops of truffle oil (if you have it)

Directions
Slice avocados in half and scoop avocado meat into mixing bowl. Juice lime on top and stir. Add the rest of the ingredients, stirring continuously to make the avocado soften into a thick creamy spread.

Note to try: But here's the secret that nobody thinks of: saute the jalapeno, red onion, and garlic for about 5-7 minutes in a bit of oil. The red onion adds a great flavor to the guac but if it's not cooked, it can be quite overpowering. Sauteing it really helps tone it down and brings out the better flavors. - source http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/c770sy5

Could also try with cherry tomatos in it

Can subsitutate lime/lemon for pickled jalapenos juice


Ideas

Steam aparagus and then chop finely or blend into guacamole. Hmmm
