Ingredients
2 ripe avocados
1 lime
1 pinch of sea salt
1 squirt of Dijon mustard
1 clove of garlic
Hot sauce and/or fresh chopped jalapeno
1 chopped shallot
1 splash of olive oil
1 splash of balsamic vinegar
Fresh ground pepper to taste
2-3 drops of truffle oil (if you have it)
Directions
Slice avocados in half and scoop avocado meat into mixing bowl. Juice lime on top and stir. Add the rest of the ingredients, stirring continuously to make the avocado soften into a thick creamy spread.
Sometimes I sprinkle cheese on top, but it’s not a must. I  never use mayonnaise. Personally, I’m not a big mayo fan, and find that it takes away from the beautifully rich taste of the avocado.  The truffle oil is a new-found addition to the recipe, but really works if you have a few drops to spare.
Let me know what you think!
