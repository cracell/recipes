## Ingredients

- 3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 medium white onion, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups dark beer
- 2 cups beef broth 
- 2 cups water
- 1 bay leaf
- 1-1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 4 stalks celery, 1-inch chunks
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- 4 potatoes, diced into 1-inch cubes

## Instructions

1. Pat beef dry and season salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown meat  (about 8-10 minutes)
1. Add onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape brown bits from bottom of pan, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; stir with wooden spoon until flour is dissolved, 1-2 minutes. Add beer, beef broth, water, bay leaf and sugar; stir with wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from bottom of pan and bring to a boil. Cover pot with lid, simmer on medium low heat for 25 min.
1. Add carrots, celery and potatoes. Cover and cook until vegetables are cooked and meat is very tender. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of sugar go a long way). This stew improves in flavor if made at least 1 day ahead.
