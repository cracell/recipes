dice one medium tomato and half an onion. set to the side. 

Open one small can of tomato sauce and place it next to the stove. 

Get two cups of water (or a smidge less) and set them next to the tomato sauce. 

Get your garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper and set THEM next to the stove. Trust me, this is important. This recipe moves fast.

Heat some oil - vegetable or olive, your choice - in a medium skillet. It's going to hold everything listed above so make sure it's big enough. Also it will need a lid.
When the oil is hot but not popping (you know, when it shimmers?), add one cup of white rice. STIR IT CONSTANTLY!! The rice will eventually turn a golden color but not quite the color of popcorn kernels. When you get here, add the water, the tomato sauce, the vegetables and then seasoning to taste.
Let the water come to a strong simmer and then lower the heat to medium (or wherever you usually set it for cooking rice). Pop the lid on that sucker and let it go for about 20-25 minutes. Don't take the lid off or your rice will be mushy!!
This is the way my mom taught me and it's always done me well. I hope you enjoy it!
